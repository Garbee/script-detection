# Script Detection

This package provides a way to audit your npm packages for installations scripts. To ease in auditing for increasing security.

Currently, this package is just shipping as-is with TypeScript files. As of Node 22.18.0, type stripping
is enabled by default. Thus, as a bit of an experiment this is getting attempted. It may not stay that way.
